## About

**Garden Manager** is an application that allows you to manage the plant life of your garden/greenhouse.  
It can record the plant type, watering cycle, and life stage of your plants all in one place. It can also generate watering schedules for your plants. 
This application can be used by anyone with a passion for gardening, whether that is an amateur just starting out, or a farmer
who has to manage hundreds of plants. This project is of interest to me as I also share a passion with managing plants, but unfortunately forget to water or prune them on time. 
With this application, I can have a centralized space to record all the plants I am maintaining.
