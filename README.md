## About

**Garden Manager** is an application that allows you to manage the plant life of your garden/greenhouse.  
It can record the plant type, watering cycle, and life stage of your plants all in one place. It can also let you know 
what plants in your garden need water,
and also let you easily manage all the information of your plants right from your computer! This application can be used by anyone with a passion for gardening who wants to be more organized; 
whether that be beginner gardeners to professionals farmers. This project is of interest to me as I also share a passion with managing plants, but *unfortunately* forget to water or prune them on time. 
With this application, I could have a centralized space to record all the plants I am maintaining.
